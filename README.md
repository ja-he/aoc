# Advent of Code

Solving the problems given for
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) (AoC)
day by day.

Solutions may be simple and simply go for a hacky quick solution or they may be
complex and aim to minimize complexity (time or space) or exhibit very safe
coding style or anything else that I may feel like on that day.
They may also come in different languages.
